                    A: 30% of your initial package purchase goes towards the purchase of your educational package (15%)
                    and fast start bonus (15%) the remaining 70% of your deposit goes into trading. Your 2X on the Bear's
                    side is figured from the entire package amount, not from the 70% put into trade on your behalf.
                    <br>
                    For example, if you deposit $1000, you are contracted to receive up to $2000 on the Bear's side,
                    even though you will only see $700 of your deposit went into trade.

            <button class="accordion">How come when we upgrade our Bear & Bull capital does not reset back to zero ??
                And What happens to my initial TA Contract?</button>
            <div class="panel">
                <p>
                    It’s because when you upgrade prior to contract fulfillment you are only paying the difference,
                    therefore you are expanding your package vs if you let your contract fulfill then pay and that is
                    then a full price renewal. If you do a full price renewal it resets your contract back to zero
                    vs expanding it only pushes the % back accordingly. So when you upgrade early you are extending
                    the same contract.

            <button class="accordion">If one lets their contract expire, do they lose their spot in the unilevel and

            <div class="panel">
                <p>
                    They have 30 days to renew the contract before losing their position in the matrix. but unilevel
                    stay the same as part of that organization

                <p>
                    If you are building a team, your Bull Cap will most likely accelerate to 2x faster than your Bear Cap.
                    If your BULL Cap reaches 2x then no you will no longer earn from the compensation plan. You will still
                    continue to earn from the Bear until your Bear reaches the 2x. In order to continue to earn from team
                    building you will need to upgrade your Trade Contract.

            <button class="accordion">What happens to my BULL commissions after I hit the 200% Cap?</button>
            <div class="panel">
                <p>
                    After you reach the BULL cap of 200%, any commissions earned from Fast Start or Unilevel will go
                    into the Reserve Cap (Not Missed Yet) Section on both Fast Start and Unilevel payout pages. You
                    will be given a 7 day grace period from the time you cap from Fast Start and a grace period up to
                    Friday Night for the Unilevel. As long as you renew your contract and have enough cap room you will
                    NOT lose any commissions. They will be released once you repurchase your trade pack of a higher
                    level. As your trade pack would have capped out and expired (as it would have doubled at 200%) you
                    will not be able to just pay the difference and upgrade to a higher pack. You will need to purchase
                    a new trade pack at the full price. SO IT’S IMPORTANT TO MAKE SURE YOU DON’T GO OVER 200%
