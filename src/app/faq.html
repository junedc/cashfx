                    A: 30% of your initial package purchase goes towards the purchase of your educational package (15%)
                    and fast start bonus (15%) the remaining 70% of your deposit goes into trading. Your 2X on the Bear's
                    side is figured from the entire package amount, not from the 70% put into trade on your behalf.
                    <br>
                    For example, if you deposit $1000, you are contracted to receive up to $2000 on the Bear's side,
                    even though you will only see $700 of your deposit went into trade.

            <button class="accordion">How come when we upgrade our Bear & Bull capital does not reset back to zero ??
                And What happens to my initial TA Contract?</button>
            <div class="panel">
                <p>
                    It’s because when you upgrade prior to contract fulfillment you are only paying the difference,
                    therefore you are expanding your package vs if you let your contract fulfill then pay and that is
                    then a full price renewal. If you do a full price renewal it resets your contract back to zero
                    vs expanding it only pushes the % back accordingly. So when you upgrade early you are extending
                    the same contract.
